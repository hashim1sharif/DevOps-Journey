AWS has a bunch of global services, hese services aren't tied to any one region and are available worldwide. Some examples are, for example, IAM, which is Identity and Access Management Service. This is where you control who has access to AWS resources. Then you have Route 53, a managed DNS service that helps you route users to your applications. CloudFront, another one which is also a CDN to help you get your content to users faster. Then you have WAF, another global service.
