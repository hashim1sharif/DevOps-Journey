                What is a Terraform State File?

Terraform’s memory of your infrastructure. Without it, Terraform wouldn’t know what it already built.

                Desire state & Current state

Desired state = what you want.
Current state = what you have.
Terraform = the tool that makes them the same.

                What are Terraform Providers?

Terraform providers are like plugins or connectors that let Terraform talk to different platforms (like AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, or even GitHub, Docker, etc.).
