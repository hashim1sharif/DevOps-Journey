# Docker Learning

what is docker?

Docker revelutionzes the way applications are built, shipped and run by using containerzation technology.

what is Containers?

Containers are lightweight, portable environments for running applications. They package an application along with all its dependencies, ensuring it runs consistently across different systems. Containers are isolated from each other and from the host system, which makes them efficient and easy to deploy.

The infrastructure repressents the physical of virtual hardware where everything runs.

The host operating system is the main OS installed on a physical or virtual machine. It manages hardware resources and runs applications like Docker or virtual machines.

Docker Engine: is the background service that enables you to create, run, and manage containers on your machine

        Benefits of Containers

Lightweight: Share the host OS, so they use less memory and start faster than virtual machines.

Portable: Run consistently across different environments (dev, test, production).

Scalable: Easy to replicate and scale horizontally for high availability.

Isolated: Each container runs independently, avoiding conflicts between apps.

Efficient CI/CD: Speeds up build, test, and deployment pipelines with clean, repeatable environments.
